# HDFS Ansible Playbook 

This contains roles to install HDFS in high availability mode, using Hadoop 2.5.0 and CDH 5.3. These roles are initially based on the playbooks found here: https://github.com/analytically/hadoop-ansible. 

These playbooks are tested to be working on Ubuntu 14.04 Precise. But if this needs to be installed on RHEL, replace `apt` with `yum`.
